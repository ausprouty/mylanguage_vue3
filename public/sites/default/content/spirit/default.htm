<p><font SIZE="5">Every Day can be an Exciting Adventure for the Christian</font> who
knows the reality of being filled with the Holy Spirit and who lives constantly, moment by
moment, under His gracious direction. </p>

<p>The Bible tells us that there are three kinds of people. 

<ol>
  <font SIZE="5">
  <li>Natural Man</li>
  </font><p>(one who has not received Christ) </p>
  <p align="center"><img SRC="english/images/law4.1.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" width="387" height="197"> </p>
  <p>&quot;A natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God; for they are
  foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually
  appraised&quot; (1 Corinthians 2:14). </p>
  <font SIZE="5">
  <li>Spiritual Man</li>
  </font><p>(One who is directed and empowered by the Holy Spirit) </p>
  <p align="center"><img SRC="english/images/law4.2.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" width="415" height="186"> </p>
  <p>&quot;He who is spiritual appraises all things...We have the mind of Christ&quot; (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?1-Corinthians+2:15">1 Corinthians 2:15</a>). </p>
  <font SIZE="5">
  <li>Carnal Man</li>
  </font><p>(One who has received Christ, but who lives in defeat because is trying to live
  the Christian life in his own strength) </p>
  <p align="center"><img SRC="english/images/law4.5.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" width="387" height="197"> </p>
  <p>&quot;And I brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to carnal men,
  as to babes in Christ. I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able
  to receive it. Indeed, even now you are not yet able, for you are still carnal. For since
  there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshy, and are you not walking like
  mere men?&quot; (1 Corinthians 3:1-3). </p>
</ol>

<hr SIZE="4">

<font SIZE="6">L</font><font SIZE="5">ife</font> </p>

<p>Jesus said, &quot;I came that they might have life, and might have it abundantly&quot;
(John 10:10). </p>

<p>&quot;I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me, and I in him, he bears
much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing&quot; (John 15:5). </p>

<p>&quot;But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law&quot;
(Galatians 5:22, 23). </p>

<p>&quot;But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and shall be
My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest
part of the earth&quot; (Acts 1:8). </p>

<p><font SIZE="5">The Spiritual Man</font> - Some spiritual traits which result from
trusting God: </p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="english/images/spiritualman.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" width="460" height="180"> </p>

<p>The degree to which these traits are manifested in the life depends upon the extent to
which the Christian trusts the Lord with every detail of his life, and upon his maturity
in Christ. One who is only beginning to understand the ministry of the Holy Spirit should
not be discouraged if he is not as fruitful as more mature Christians who have known and
experienced this truth for a longer period. </p>

<p><i>Why is it that most Christians are not experiencing the abundant life?</i> </p>

<hr SIZE="4">

<p>The carnal man trusts in his own efforts to live the Christian life: 

<ol>
  <li>He is either uninformed about, or has forgotten, God's love, forgiveness, and power (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Romans+5:8-10">Romans 5:8-10</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Hebrews+10:1-25">Hebrews 10:1-25</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?1-John+1-2:3">1 John 1; 2:1-3</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?2-Peter+1:9">2 Peter 1:9</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Acts+1:8">Acts 1:8</a>). </li>
  <li>He has an up-and-down spiritual experience. </li>
  <li>He cannot understand himself - he wants to do what is right, but cannot. </li>
  <li>He fails to draw upon the power of the Holy Spirit to live the Christian life. </li>
</ol>

<p>(<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?1-Corinthians+3:1-3">1 Corinthians 3:1-3</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Romans+7:15-24">Romans 7:15-24</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Romans+8:7">8:7</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Galatians+5:16-18">Galatians 5:16-18</a>) </p>

<p><font SIZE="5">The Carnal Man</font> - Some or all of the following traits may
characterize the Christian who does not fully trust God: </p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="english/images/carnalman.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" width="468" height="180"> </p>

<p>(The individual who professes to be a Christian but who continues to practice sin
should realize that he may not be a Christian at all, according to <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?1-John+2:3">1 John 2:3</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?1-John+3:6">3:6</a>, <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?1-John+3:9">9</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Ephesians+5:5">Ephesians 5:5</a>). </p>

<p><i>The third truth gives us the only solution to this problem...</i> </p>

<hr SIZE="4">

the Result of Being Filled (Directed and Empowered) by the Holy Spirit</font> </p>

<p>The Spirit-filled life is the Christ-directed life by which Christ lives His life in
and through us in the power of the Holy Spirit (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?John+15">John 15</a>). 

<ol>
  <li>One becomes a Christian through the ministry of the Holy Spirit, according to <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?John+3:1-8">John 3:1-8</a>. From the moment of
    spiritual birth, the Christian is indwelt by the Holy Spirit at all times (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?John+1:12">John 1:12</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Colossians+2:9-10">Colossians 2:9, 10</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?John+14:16-17">John 14:16, 17</a>). <b>Though all
    Christians are indwelt by the Holy Spirit, not all Christians are filled (directed and
    empowered) by the Holy Spirit.</b> </li>
  <li>The Holy Spirit is the source of the overflowing life (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?John+7:37-39">John 7:37-39</a>). </li>
  <li>The Holy Spirit came to glorify Christ (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?John+16:1-15">John 16:1-15</a>). When one is filled
    with the Holy Spirit, he is a true disciple of Christ. </li>
  <li>In His last command before His ascension, Christ promised the power of the Holy Spirit
    to enable us to be witnesses for Him (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Acts+1:1-9">Acts
    1:1-9</a>). </li>
</ol>

<p><i>How, then, can one be filled with the Holy Spirit?</i> </p>

<hr SIZE="4">

Which Christ Promised to Each Christian.</font> </p>

<p>You can appropriate the filling of the Holy Spirit <b>right now</b> if you: 

<ol>
  <li>Sincerely desire to be directed and empowered by the Holy Spirit (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Matthew+5:6">Matthew 5:6</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?John+7:37-39">John 7:37-39</a>). </li>
  <li>Confess your sins. <br>
    By <b>faith</b> thank God that He <b>has</b> forgiven all of your sins - past, present and
    future - because Christ died for you (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Colossians+2:13-15">Colossians 2:13-15</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?1-John+1-2:3">1 John 1; 2:1-3</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Hebrews+10:1-17">Hebrews 10:1-17</a>). </li>
  <li>Present every area of your life to God (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Romans+12:1-2">Romans 12:1, 2</a>). </li>
  <li>By <b>faith</b> claim the fullness of the Holy Spirit, according to: <ol>
      <li><b>His Command</b> - Be filled with the Spirit. &quot;And do not get drunk with wine,
        for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit&quot; (Ephesians 5:18). </li>
      <li><b>His Promise</b> - He will always answer when we pray according to His will. &quot;And
        this is the confidence which we have before Him, that, if we ask anything according to His
        will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we
        have the requests which we have asked of Him&quot; (1 John 5:14, 15). </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><i>Faith can be expressed through prayer...</i> </p>

<hr SIZE="4">

<p align="center"><font SIZE="6">H</font><font SIZE="5">ow to</font> <font SIZE="6">P</font><font SIZE="5">ray in</font> <font SIZE="6">F</font><font SIZE="5">aith to be</font> <font SIZE="6">F</font><font SIZE="5">illed with the</font> <font SIZE="6">H</font><font SIZE="5">oly</font> <font SIZE="6">S</font><font SIZE="5">pirit</font> </p>

<p>We are filled with the Holy Spirit by <b>faith</b> alone. However, true prayer is one
way of expressing your faith. The following is a suggested prayer: </p>

<p>&quot;Dear Father, I need You. I acknowledge that I have been directing my own life and
that, as a result, I have sinned against You. I thank You that You have forgiven my sins
through Christ's death on the cross for me. I now invite Christ to again take His place on
the throne of my life. Fill me with the Holy Spirit as You <b>commanded</b> me to be
filled, and as You <b>promised</b> in Your Word that You would do if I asked in faith. I
now thank You for directing my life and for filling me with the Holy Spirit.&quot; </p>

<p>Does this prayer express the desire of your heart? If so, bow in prayer and trust God
to fill you with the Holy Spirit <b>right now</b>. </p>

<hr SIZE="4">

<p align="center"><font SIZE="6">H</font><font SIZE="5">ow to</font> <font SIZE="6">K</font><font SIZE="5">now</font> <font SIZE="6">T</font><font SIZE="5">hat</font> <font SIZE="6">Y</font><font SIZE="5">ou are</font> <font SIZE="6">F</font><font SIZE="5">illed</font> <font SIZE="6">(D</font><font SIZE="5">irected and</font> <font SIZE="6">E</font><font SIZE="5">mpowered</font><font SIZE="6">)</font> <font SIZE="5">with the</font> <font SIZE="6">H</font><font SIZE="5">oly</font>
<font SIZE="6">S</font><font SIZE="5">pirit</font> </p>

<p>Did you ask God to fill you with the Holy Spirit? Do you know that you are now filled
with the Holy Spirit? On what authority? (On the trustworthiness of God Himself and His
Word: <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Hebrews+11:6">Hebrews 11:6</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Romans+14:22-23">Romans 14:22, 23</a>.)<br>
Do not depend upon feelings. The promise of God's Word, not our feelings, is our
authority. The Christian lives by faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of God Himself and
His Word. This train diagram illustrates the relationship between <b>fact</b> (God and His
Word), <b>faith</b> (our trust in God and His Word), and <b>feeling</b> (the result of our
faith and obedience) (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?John+14:21">John 14:21</a>).
</p>

<p align="center"><img SRC="english/images/train.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" width="450" height="101"> </p>

<p>The train will run with or without the caboose. However, it would be futile to attempt
to pull the train by the caboose. In the same way, we, as Christians, do not depend upon
feelings or emotions, but we place our faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of God and the
promises of His Word. </p>

<p>Faith (trust in God and in His promises) is the only means by which a Christian can
live the Spirit-directed life. As you continue to trust Christ moment by moment: 

<ol>
  <li>Your life will demonstrate more and more of the fruit of the Spirit (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Galatians+5:22-23">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>) and will
    be more and more conformed to the image of Christ (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Romans+12:2">Romans 12:2</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?2-Corinthians+3:18">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>). </li>
  <li>Your prayer life and study of God's Word will become more meaningful. </li>
  <li>You will experience His power in witnessing (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Acts+1:8">Acts 1:8</a>). </li>
  <li>You will be prepared for spiritual conflict against the world (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?1-John+2:15-17">1 John 2:15-17</a>); against the
    flesh (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Galatians+5:16-17">Galatians 5:16-17</a>);
    and against Satan (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?1-Peter+5:7-9">1 Peter 5:7-9</a>;
    <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Ephesians+6:10-13">Ephesians 6:10-13</a>). </li>
  <li>You will experience His power to resist temptation and sin (<a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?1-Corinthians+10:13">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Philippians+4:13">Philippians 4:13</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Ephesians+1:19-23">Ephesians 1:19-23</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?2-Timothy+1:7">2 Timothy 1:7</a>; <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Romans+6:1-16">Romans 6:1-16</a>). </li>

<p>By faith you can continue to experience God's love and forgiveness. </p>

<p>If you become aware of an area of your life (an attitude or an action) that is
displeasing to the Lord, even though you are walking with Him and sincerely desiring to
serve Him, simply thank God that He has forgiven your sins - past, present and future - on
the basis of Christ's death on the cross. Claim His love and forgiveness by faith and
continue to have fellowship with Him. </p>

<p>If you retake the throne of your life through sin - a definite act of disobedience -
breathe spiritually. </p>

<p><b>Spiritual breathing</b> (exhaling the impure and inhaling the pure) is an exercise
in faith that enables you to continue to experience God's love and forgiveness. 

<ol>
  <li><b>Exhale</b> - confess your sin - agree with God concerning your sin and thank Him for
    His forgiveness of it, according to <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?1-John+1:9">1
    John 1:9</a> and <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Hebrews+10:1-25">Hebrews 10:1-25</a>.
    Confession involves repentance - a change in attitude and action. </li>
  <li><b>Inhale</b> - surrender the control of your life to Christ, and appropriate (receive)
    the fullness of the Holy Spirit by faith. Trust that He now directs and empowers you;
    according to the <b>command</b> of <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?Ephesians+5:18">Ephesians
    5:18</a>, and the <b>promise</b> of <a HREF="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?1-John+5:14-15">1 John 5:14, 15</a>. </li>

<p>Millions of copies of the booklet, &quot;Have You Made the Wonderful Discovery of the
Spirit-filled Life?&quot; have been distributed in most major languages around the world.
As a result, thousands of Christians have learned how to experience the power and control
of the Holy Spirit, moment by moment. Through the abundant life which Christ promises, and
which they are now experiencing, they have become more effective in sharing their faith in
Christ with others. Experience has confirmed the validity of Christ's command to the
disciples to wait until they were empowered by the Holy Spirit before going forth to the
world to share the good news of His love and forgiveness. Most Christians, when they have
learned this truth concerning the Holy Spirit, want to be actively sharing Christ and
helping to fulfill the Great Commission in our generation. </p>
