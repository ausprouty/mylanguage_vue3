      God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the 
      Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. 
      These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of 
      God, in order that you may <B>know</B> that you have eternal life" (1 John 
      5:11-13). </P>
      <P>Thank God often that Christ is in your life and that He will never 
      leave you (<A 
      href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=hebrews+13:5" 
      target=_blank>Hebrews 13:5</A>). You can know on the basis of His promise 
      that Christ lives in you and that you have eternal life from the very 
      moment you invite Him in. He will not deceive you. </P>
      <P><I>An important reminder...</I> </P>

      <P>The promise of God's Word, the Bible - not our feelings - is our 
      authority. The Christian lives by faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of 
      God Himself and His Word. This train diagram illustrates the relationship 
      among <B>fact</B> (God and His Word), <B>faith</B> (our trust in God and 
      His Word), and <B>feeling</B> (the result of our faith and obedience) (<A

      <P>The train will run with or without a caboose. However, it would be 
      useless to attempt to pull the train by the caboose. In the same way, as 
      Christians we do not depend on feelings or emotions, but we place our 
      faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of God and the promises of His Word.

      <P>The moment that you received Christ by faith, as an act of the will, 
      many things happened, including the following:

        <LI>Christ came into your life (<A

        target=_blank>John 1:12)</A>.

        target=_blank>John 5:24</A>). 
        <LI>You began the great adventure for which God created you (<A

      <P>Can you think of anything more wonderful that could happen to you than 
      receiving Christ? Would you like to thank God in prayer right now for what 
      He has done for you? By thanking God, you demonstrate your faith. </P>

      <P>Spiritual growth results from trusting Jesus Christ. "The righteous man 
      shall live by faith" (Galatians 3:11). A life of faith will enable you to 
      trust God increasingly with every detail of your life, and to practice the

      <P>God's Word instructs us not to forsake "the assembling of ourselves 
      together" (Hebrews 10:25). Several logs burn brightly together; but put 
      one aside on the cold hearth and the fire goes out. So it is with your 
      relationship with other Christians. </P>
      <P>If you do not belong to a church, do not wait to be invited. Take the 
      initiative; call the pastor of a nearby church where Christ is honored and 
      His Word is preached. Start this week, and make plans to attend regularly.
